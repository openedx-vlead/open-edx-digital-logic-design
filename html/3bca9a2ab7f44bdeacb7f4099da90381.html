<li>With The help of Theory Page , try to build the Multiplexer Circuit.</li>
<li>First of all build the 2 X 1 Multiplexer.</li>
<li>Then use it to build the 8 X 1 multiplexer</li>
<li>If You are unable to make it , load or export the circuit directly and use it</li>
<li>There is an import feature, which lets you construct building blocks. Click on import and then click on circuit board to see the imported block. For more details, refer import section in manual.</li>
