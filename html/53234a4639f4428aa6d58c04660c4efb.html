<li>With The help of Theory Page , try to build the Register Circuit.</li>
<li>First of all build the Simple Shift Register.</li>
<li>Then try to build the Parallel Load shift Register</li>
<li>If You are unable to make it , load or export the circuit directly and use it</li>
<li>Use time variant input pulses to analyze the output</li>
<li>There is an import feature, which lets you construct building blocks. Click on import and then click on circuit board to see the imported block. For more details, refer import section in manual.</li>
