<h2>NAND and NOR Latches</h2>
<h3>NOR Latch</h3>
<p><img alt="2-d vectors" src="http://cse15-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/images/NOR.png" /> <br /> It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates. The stored bit is present on the output marked Q. While the S and R inputs are both low, feedback maintains the Q and Q outputs in a constant state, with Q the complement of Q. If S (Set) is pulsed high while R (Reset) is held low, then the Q output is forced high, and stays high when S returns to low; similarly, if R is pulsed high while S is held low, then the Q output is forced low, and stays low when R returns to low.</p>
<h3>NAND Latch</h3>
<p><img alt="2-d vectors" src="http://cse15-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/images/NAND.png" /> <br /> This is an alternate model of the simple SR latch built with NAND logic gates. Set and reset now become active low signals, denoted S and R respectively. Otherwise, operation is identical to that of the SR latch. Historically, SR-latches have been predominant despite the notational inconvenience of active-low inputs</p>
<h2>JK Flip Flop</h2>
<p><img alt="2-d vectors" src="http://cse15-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/images/master_slave.gif" /><br /> JK flip flop is mostly implemented as Master Slave flip flop. The information present at at J and K inputs is transmitted to master flip-flop on positive edge of a clock pulse and held there until negative pulse occurs, after which it is allowed to pass through the slave flip-flop.</p>
<h2>JK Timing Digram</h2>
<p>The following Digram depicts the change of JK flip flop Output with time pulse. It is negative edge triggered. <br /> <img alt="2-d vectors" src="http://cse15-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/images/JK_flipflop_timing.gif" /></p>
