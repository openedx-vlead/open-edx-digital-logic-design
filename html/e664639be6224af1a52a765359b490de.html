<p>This module explains how to build a Programmable 1-bit ALU. In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers.</p>

<p>Most ALUs can perform the following operations: <br /> Bitwise logic operations (AND, NOT, OR, XOR) <br /> Integer arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and sometimes multiplication and division, though this is more expensive) <br /> Bit-shifting operations (shifting or rotating a word by a specified number of bits to the left or right, with or without sign extension). Shifts can be seen as multiplications and divisions by a power of two. <br /> </p>
<h3>Inputs and Outputs</h3>
<p>The inputs to the ALU are the data to be operated on (called operands) and a code from the control unit indicating which operation to perform. Its output is the result of the computation.</p>
