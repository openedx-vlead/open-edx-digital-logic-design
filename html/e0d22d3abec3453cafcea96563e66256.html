<p>1) A student was asked to design the state diagram of a circuit to detect 1011 occurs in a given input sequence. So, he came up with the following design. <br /><br /> <img src="http://cse15-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/images/state_diagram.png" width="60%" /> <br /><br /> a) What will be the sequence of states and outputs for the following input sequence 10101101011000<br /> b) Does the circuit correctly solve the problem. Why/why not? If not then what should be the change in the state diagram?<br /><br /> 2) Design a clocked sequential circuit for the following state diagram : <br /><br /> <img src="http://cse15-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/images/state_diagram2.png" width="60%" /><br /><br /> Use JK flip flops and combinational logic in the design. Import the flip flops as black boxes. There will be an input x to the circuit.<br /><br /> (HINT: Make excitation tables for J,K of the flip flops. The present state, and input x will be fed to combinational logic, which will generate J,K for each flip flop.)</p>
