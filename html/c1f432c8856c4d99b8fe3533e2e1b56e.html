<li>With The help of Theory Page , try to build the decoder.</li>
<li>If You are unable to make it , load or export the circuit directly and use it</li>
<li>Analyze the values of a,b,c,d,e,f,g corresponding to the image given in theory page to see how different number are formed</li>
<li>There is an import feature, which lets you construct building blocks. Click on import and then click on circuit board to see the imported block. For more details, refer import section in manual.</li>
